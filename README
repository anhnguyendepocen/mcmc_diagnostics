This repository contains code for testing the convergence of MCMCs for a
couple examples where we know the theoretical convergence rates.

The R code for constructing the diagnostics can be found in diagnostics.R,
while the scripts using these diagnostics for particular models are prefixed
with diagnostics_*

Enjoy!
